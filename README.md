# Hi there, I'm Radomir! 👋

I'm an **Adobe Certified Magento Developer** specializing in building high-performance eCommerce solutions that drive growth and revenue. With over 7 years in the game, I partner with businesses to transform their technical challenges into strategic advantages.

### 🚀 My Core Philosophy: More Than Just Code

I believe the best developers are technical partners, not just coders. My approach is built on three key principles:

1.  **Business-First Mindset:** I start by understanding your business goals. A new feature isn't just a ticket—it's a tool to increase your conversion rate, improve user experience, or streamline operations.

2.  **Future-Proof Architecture:** I write clean, scalable code that follows Magento best practices. This means your site will be stable, secure, and ready for future upgrades, not a tangled mess for the next developer.

3.  **Innovating with AI:** I am actively exploring how **AI-driven tools** can enhance the Magento ecosystem. This includes everything from AI-powered search and personalized product recommendations to automated content generation, helping you stay ahead of the curve.
